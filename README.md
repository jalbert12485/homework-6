# homework-6

This project is completed as an assignment for a coding bootcamp.  

In this webpage, we provide the user with the current temperature information, as well as a 5 day forecast.  Initially, there will be no forecast, but the user can search by city name by typing into the search bar on the left hand side.  After doing this, the city will be saved to the local storage so the browser can recall the searches for future use.  The user may save as many cities as they like to look it.

When the user initially saves a city, or clicks on the city name from his/her list, the user will be provided with the current temperature and the forecast from the city as provided by openweathermap.org's api information.  If the user wishes to delete a city from his/her list, they can press the remove button next to that city.  If the user types in a non-valid city name, there will be no information displayed since none will come back from the api.
